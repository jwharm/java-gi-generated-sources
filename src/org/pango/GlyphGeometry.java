/**
 * The <code>PangoGlyphGeometry</code> structure contains width and positioning
 * information for a single glyph.
 * 
 * Note that @width is not guaranteed to be the same as the glyph
 * extents. Kerning and other positioning applied during shaping will
 * affect both the @width and the @x_offset for the glyphs in the
 * glyph string that results from shaping.
 * 
 * The information in this struct is intended for rendering the glyphs,
 * as follows:
 * 
 * 1. Assume the current point is (x, y)
 * 2. Render the current glyph at (x + x_offset, y + y_offset),
 * 3. Advance the current point to (x + width, y)
 * 4. Render the next glyph
