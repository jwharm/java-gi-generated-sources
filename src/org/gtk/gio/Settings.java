/**
 * The {@link Settings} class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
 * application settings.
 * <p>
 * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
 * settings with {@link Settings} is typically extremely fast: on
 * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
 * {@link org.gtk.glib.HashTable} lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
 * of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
 * for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
 * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
 * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
 * a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
 * even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
 * only ever modify {@link Settings} keys in response to explicit user action.
 * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
 * made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
 * of preferences widgets.  The built-in g_settings_bind() functionality
 * is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
 * result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
 * <p>
 * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 * <p>
 * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be '[relocatable][gsettings-relocatable]', i.e. not equipped with
 * a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 * <p>
 * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
 * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
 * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
 * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
 * "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
 * Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
 * they often did in GConf.
 * <p>
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as {@link org.gtk.glib.Variant}, and allows any {@link org.gtk.glib.VariantType} for keys. Key names
 * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
 * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
 * <p>
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * {@code gettext-domain} attribute of the &lt;schemalist> or <schema&gt;
 * elements and the category that is specified in the {@code l10n} attribute of
 * the &lt;default&gt; element. The string which is translated includes all text in
 * the &lt;default&gt; element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
 * <p>
 * The {@code l10n} attribute must be set to {@code messages} or {@code time}, and sets the
 * [locale category for
 * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html{@code index}-locale-categories-1).
 * The {@code messages} category should be used by default; use {@code time} for
 * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
 * XML comment immediately above the &lt;default&gt; element â€” it is recommended to
 * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
 * implications of the default value. An optional translation {@code context}
 * attribute can be set on the &lt;default&gt; element to disambiguate multiple
 * defaults which use the same string.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * |[
 *  <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
 *       GVariant serialization syntax.
 *       See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
 *  &lt;default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default&gt;
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
 * {@code GVariants} (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
 * errors will occur.
 * <p>
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas]
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
 * <p>
 * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
 * <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd">gschema.dtd</a>
 * <p>
 * The [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] tool expects schema
 * files to have the extension {@code .gschema.xml}.
 * <p>
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
 * id attribute of the &lt;schema&gt; element). The convention for schema
 * ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
 * e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
 * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
 * and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
 * associated with one named application, the id should not use
 * StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
 * <p>
 * In addition to {@link org.gtk.glib.Variant} types, keys can have types that have
 * enumerated types. These can be described by a &lt;choice&gt;,
 * &lt;enum> or <flags&gt; element, as seen in the
 * [example][schema-enumerated]. The underlying type of such a key
 * is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(), g_settings_set_enum(),
 * g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags() access the numeric values
 * corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
 * <p>
 * An example for default value:
 * |[
 * &lt;schemalist&gt;
 *   &lt;schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test"&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name="greeting" type="s"&gt;
 *       &lt;default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default&gt;
 *       &lt;summary>A greeting</summary&gt;
 *       &lt;description&gt;
 *         Greeting of the invading martians
 *       &lt;/description&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name="box" type="(ii)"&gt;
 *       &lt;default>(20,30)</default&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name="empty-string" type="s"&gt;
 *       &lt;default>""</default&gt;
 *       &lt;summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *   &lt;/schema&gt;
 * &lt;/schemalist&gt;
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
 * |[
 * &lt;schemalist&gt;
 * <p>
 *   &lt;enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum"&gt;
 *     &lt;value nick="first" value="1"/&gt;
 *     &lt;value nick="second" value="2"/&gt;
 *   &lt;/enum&gt;
 * <p>
 *   &lt;flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags"&gt;
 *     &lt;value nick="flag1" value="1"/&gt;
 *     &lt;value nick="flag2" value="2"/&gt;
 *     &lt;value nick="flag3" value="4"/&gt;
 *   &lt;/flags&gt;
 * <p>
 *   &lt;schema id="org.gtk.Test"&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name="key-with-range" type="i"&gt;
 *       &lt;range min="1" max="100"/&gt;
 *       &lt;default>10</default&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name="key-with-choices" type="s"&gt;
 *       &lt;choices&gt;
 *         &lt;choice value='Elisabeth'/&gt;
 *         &lt;choice value='Annabeth'/&gt;
 *         &lt;choice value='Joe'/&gt;
 *       &lt;/choices&gt;
 *       &lt;aliases&gt;
 *         &lt;alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/&gt;
 *         &lt;alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/&gt;
 *       &lt;/aliases&gt;
 *       &lt;default>'Joe'</default&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'&gt;
 *       &lt;default>'first'</default&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 * <p>
 *     &lt;key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'&gt;
 *       &lt;default>["flag1","flag2"]</default&gt;
 *     &lt;/key&gt;
 *   &lt;/schema&gt;
 * &lt;/schemalist&gt;
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * <h2>Vendor overrides</h2>
 * <p>
 * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 * is inconvenient and error-prone,
 * [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] reads so-called vendor
 * override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
 * schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
 * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
 * serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
 * |[
 *     [org.gtk.Example]
 *     key1='string'
 *     key2=1.5
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
 * {@code .gschema.override}.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Binding</h2>
 * <p>
 * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind {@link org.gtk.gobject.Object} properties
 * directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
 * has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
 * propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
 * between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
 * <p>
 * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 * looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
 * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 * If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 * {@link SettingsBindFlags#NO_SENSITIVITY} flag.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Relocatable schemas # {#gsettings-relocatable}</h2>
 * <p>
 * A relocatable schema is one with no {@code path} attribute specified on its
 * &lt;schema&gt; element. By using g_settings_new_with_path(), a {@link Settings} object
 * can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
 * instance. Paths passed to g_settings_new_with_path() will typically be
 * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
 * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
 * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
 * dependency library.
 * <p>
 * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
 * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
 * {@code org.foo.MyApp.Window}, it could be instantiated for paths
 * {@code /org/foo/MyApp/main/}, {@code /org/foo/MyApp/document-1/},
 * {@code /org/foo/MyApp/document-2/}, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
 * they can be specified as &lt;child&gt; elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
 * |[
 * &lt;schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/"&gt;
 *   &lt;child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/&gt;
 * &lt;/schema&gt;
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * <h2>Build system integration # {#gsettings-build-system}</h2>
 * <p>
 * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
 * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
 * following to your {@code configure.ac}:
 * |[
 * GLIB_GSETTINGS
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * In the appropriate {@code Makefile.am}, use the following snippet to compile and
 * install the named schema:
 * |[
 * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
 * <p>
 * {@code GSETTINGS_RULES}@
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
 * translation. Assuming it sets the {@code gettext-domain} attribute, a schema may
 * be marked for translation by adding it to {@code POTFILES.in}, assuming gettext
 * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
 * |[
 * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
 * |[
 * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the &lt;summary&gt; and
 * &lt;description> elements, and also any <default&gt; elements which have a {@code l10n}
 * attribute set. Translations must not be included in the {@code .gschema.xml} file
 * by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
 * {@code .gschema.xml.in} template.
 * <p>
 * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
 * schema, it can either be defined manually using an &lt;enum&gt; element in the
 * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
 * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
 * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant {@code Makefile.am}:
 * |[
 * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
 * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
 * ]|
 * <p>
 * {@code gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE} specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
 * which are specified in {@code gsettings_ENUM_FILES}. This will generate a
 * {@code org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml} file containing the extracted enums, which will be
 * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
 * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
 * {@code EXTRA_DIST}.
