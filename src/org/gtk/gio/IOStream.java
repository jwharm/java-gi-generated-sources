/**
 * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 * <p>
 * Examples of {@link IOStream} objects are {@link SocketConnection}, which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and {@link FileIOStream}, which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 * <p>
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
 * <p>
 * The {@link IOStream} object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the {@link IOStream}
 * object alive. If the {@link IOStream} object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return {@link IOErrorEnum#CLOSED} for all operations.
 * <p>
 * To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * {@link IOStream} may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * "half-closed" states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 * <p>
 * Operations on {@code GIOStreams} cannot be started while another operation on the
 * {@link IOStream} or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the {@link InputStream} and write to the {@link OutputStream} simultaneously
 * (either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
 * thread), but an application cannot start any {@link IOStream} operation while there
 * is a {@link IOStream}, {@link InputStream} or {@link OutputStream} operation in progress, and
 * an application canâ€™t start any {@link InputStream} or {@link OutputStream} operation
 * while there is a {@link IOStream} operation in progress.
 * <p>
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given {@link org.gtk.glib.MainContext} (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
 * started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
 * {@link org.gtk.glib.MainContext}.
 * <p>
 * GIO may run operations on {@code GIOStreams} from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as {@link BufferedInputStream} or {@link TlsConnection}. With such wrapper APIs,
 * application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
 * the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
 * not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
 * stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

     * {@link IOErrorEnum#CLOSED}. Closing a stream multiple times will not

     * Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
     * is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
     * resources are released as early as possible.
     * <p>
     * Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file
     * descriptor) open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for
     * the individual stream for details.
     * <p>
     * On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the
     * close operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed
     * to close will still return {@link IOErrorEnum#CLOSED} for all operations.
     * Still, it is important to check and report the error to the user,
     * otherwise there might be a loss of data as all data might not be written.
     * <p>
     * If {@code cancellable} is not NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
     * triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
     * was cancelled, the error {@link IOErrorEnum#CANCELLED} will be returned.
     * Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
     * can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
