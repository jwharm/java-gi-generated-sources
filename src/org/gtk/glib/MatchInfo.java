     * GRegex supports the concept of partial matching by means of the

     * g_regex_match() or g_regex_match_full() is, as usual, {@code true}

     * {@link RegexMatchFlags#PARTIAL_HARD} is that when a partial match is encountered
     * with {@link RegexMatchFlags#PARTIAL_SOFT}, matching continues to search for a
     * possible complete match, while with {@link RegexMatchFlags#PARTIAL_HARD} matching
     * stops at the partial match.
     * When both {@link RegexMatchFlags#PARTIAL_SOFT} and {@link RegexMatchFlags#PARTIAL_HARD}
     * are set, the latter takes precedence.
     * <p>
     * There were formerly some restrictions on the pattern for partial matching.
