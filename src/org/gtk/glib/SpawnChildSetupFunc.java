/**
 * Specifies the type of the setup function passed to g_spawn_async(),
 * g_spawn_sync() and g_spawn_async_with_pipes(), which can, in very
 * limited ways, be used to affect the child&#39;s execution.
 * <p>
 * On POSIX platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib
 * has performed all the setup it plans to perform, but before calling
 * exec(). Actions taken in this function will only affect the child,
 * not the parent.
 * <p>
 * On Windows, the function is called in the parent. Its usefulness on
 * Windows is thus questionable. In many cases executing the child setup
 * function in the parent can have ill effects, and you should be very
 * careful when porting software to Windows that uses child setup
 * functions.
 * <p>
 * However, even on POSIX, you are extremely limited in what you can
 * safely do from a #GSpawnChildSetupFunc, because any mutexes that were
 * held by other threads in the parent process at the time of the fork()
 * will still be locked in the child process, and they will never be
 * unlocked (since the threads that held them don&#39;t exist in the child).
 * POSIX allows only async-signal-safe functions (see signal(7)) to be
 * called in the child between fork() and exec(), which drastically limits
 * the usefulness of child setup functions.
 * <p>
 * In particular, it is not safe to call any function which may
 * call malloc(), which includes POSIX functions such as setenv().
 * If you need to set up the child environment differently from
 * the parent, you should use g_get_environ(), g_environ_setenv(),
 * and g_environ_unsetenv(), and then pass the complete environment
 * list to the <code>g_spawn...</code> function.
