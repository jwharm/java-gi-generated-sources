/**
 * A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user's
 * session bus.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link TestDBus} modifies the userâ€™s environment, calling setenv().
 * This is not thread-safe, so all {@link TestDBus} calls should be completed before
 * threads are spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access
 * conflicts to environment variables shared between {@link TestDBus} and other
 * threads.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Creating unit tests using GTestDBus</h2>
 * <p>
 * Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
 * D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
 * usually don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
 * target system. The {@link TestDBus} object makes this easier for us by taking care
 * of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
 * up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
 * code tree.
 * <p>
 * The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
 * D-Bus daemon. Typically a {@code services} subdirectory of your {@code tests} directory
 * is a good place to put this file.
 * <p>
 * The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
 * uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
 * achieve this by adding a file such as {@code my-server.service.in} in the services
 * directory and have it processed by configure.
 * <pre>{@code 
 *     [D-BUS Service]
 *     Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
 *     Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
 * }</pre>
 * You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
 * fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
 * test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
 * preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
 * <pre>{@code 
 *     -DTEST_SERVICES=\\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\\"
 * }</pre>
 *     Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
 * you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the {@link TestDBus} scaffolding.
 * <p>
 * An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
 * here:
 * <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c">gdbus-test-fixture.c</a>
 * <p>
 * Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
 * service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
 * some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
 * service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your test service
 * not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances are that your service
 * and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there is an older version of the
 * schema file sitting in the install location).
 * <p>
 * Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
 * environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
 * created by {@link TestDBus} and then in turn inherited by any services the
 * D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
 * a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
 * rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
 * {@code GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR} to the in tree directory holding your schemas
 * in the above fixture_setup() routine.
 * <p>
 * The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This can be achieved
 * by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running test cases, an autotools setup might
 * do the following in the directory holding schemas:
 * <pre>{@code 
 *     all-am:
 *             $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
 * 
 *     CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
 * }</pre>
