/**
 * A {@link WeakNotify} function can be added to an object as a callback that gets
 * triggered when the object is finalized.
 * <p>
 * Since the object is already being disposed when the {@link WeakNotify} is called,
 * there's not much you could do with the object, apart from e.g. using its
 * address as hash-index or the like.
 * <p>
 * In particular, this means itâ€™s invalid to call g_object_ref(),
 * g_weak_ref_init(), g_weak_ref_set(), g_object_add_toggle_ref(),
 * g_object_weak_ref(), g_object_add_weak_pointer() or any function which calls
 * them on the object from this callback.
